# NXP NT3H1101 Basic Library
----
This is a library for the NXP NT3H1101 component. It is forked from the
SmartEverything version and adapted for a Linux environment.

The NTAG I2C is the first product of NXP NTAG family offering both
contactless and contact interfaces.  In addition to the passive NFC
Forum compliant contactless interface, the IC features an I2C contact
interface, which can communicate with a microcontroller if the NTAG I2C
is powered from an external power supply.
