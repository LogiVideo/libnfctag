This package is intended for a GNU/Linux based system and uses the autoconf /
automake build system.

Run the following commands to install:
        autoreconf -i
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

The NT3H1101 device is expected to be on "/dev/i2c-0" at address 0x55. However,
both of these can be changed with configure options:
        --with-i2c-bus=<bus-number>
allows you to specify the final number, e.g.
        --with-i2c-bus-2
will have the library open "/dev/i2c-2" to find the device.

Similarly, the i2c address can be altered with
        --with-i2c-address=<addr>
NOTE: the actual i2c address is set by altering the first byte of the
configuration page; the library currently does _not_ do this, and assumes that
the address has already been set (e.g. by `i2c_transfer`) before using
the library. This may change in a future release.
